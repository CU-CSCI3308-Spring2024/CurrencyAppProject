TA meeting - April 8th 2024:
All members said what they worked on during the past weeek and what they plan on doing for the upcoming week. 
Some of the feedbacks from Cory were: 
- Move the converter dropdown code from front-end to back-end
- Remember to close the issue in the project once it's done
