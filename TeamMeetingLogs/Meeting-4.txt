Some of the feedbacks from Cory were: 
- He said that the multiple languages feature is not necessary as the project is coming to and end so not to worry too much about it
- He mentioned that next weeks meeetings are diffents that the ones we have been having, for instance they aren‚Äôt graded. They will serve as practice for the presentation and demo.
- During the next weeks he will give feedback on the features so we should get the presentation and report done as soon as possible in order to help us as much as possible.
